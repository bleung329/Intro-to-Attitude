>>Preface & Acknowledgements:
This text is essentially CU Boulder's Pt 1 Spacecraft Dynamics and Control Specialization on Coursera, distilled down to the key takeaways. Highly recommend you take the course, if you got the time and energy.
What this isnt:
	An extremely thorough textbook stuffed to the gills with derivations
	A text that teaches you about control theory
What this is:
	An informal intro to attitude determination for the aspiring spacecraft controls engineer
	A springboard into any further studies you may undertake.

>>Prerequisites:
You'll want to know linear algebra before looking at this text. Actually, you should just learn linear algebra in general, it's super useful. An undergraduate/high school course is sufficient. If you did neither, I personally learned using UT Austin's "Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers" on edX and ran through the gauntlet of math exercises. If you want to learn with your own methods, by all means.

>>Ch 1. What is Attitude Anyways?
Hint, it isn't a state of mind. The most straightforward description of attitude in a spacecraft/aircraft context is:
"Attitude is a body's angular orientation with respect to a reference frame."
This is lovely, but ... what does it tell us? 
>>Ch 2. The DCM (Direction Cosine Matrix)

>>Ch 3. Euler Angles

>>Ch 4. Principal Rotation Vectors

>>Ch 5. Quaternions
Ah, the mighty quaternion. The mathematical foundation behind quaternions was developed by Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1843, after having an epiphany on a bridge. They can be called Euler parameters sometimes, but quaternion does sound a lot sexier. Those who deftly wield it are revered amongst engineers. The name alone strikes fear and awe into those not privy to its inner workings. But ... why would you use quaternions with all these nice 3 coordinate attitude descriptors?
>The Good:
	Non Singular - Because this is a 4 coordinate description, singularities are no more. We will no longer be held down by the shackles of gimbal lock.
	Linear Differential Kinematic Equation - Engineers and the rare practical mathematicians LOVE linear equations. 
	Works for big and small rotations - If you bought the whole navball, you will use the whole navball.
>The Bad:
	Constraint equation must be identified at all times
	Not as easy to visualize - This is probably the reason that people fear it so much. It's not as intuitive as something like Euler angles.

[insert definition here]

Yes. That's it. When looked at through the lens of PRVs, it is actually that easy.
